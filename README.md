## Goals
You have been given an HTML file which has all of the required content to recreate the provided  screenshot using only CSS.  Do not change the body of the html file, just the head to link the CSS stylesheet.  As always, use best practices, e.g. using an (unmodified) default style sheet, only lowercase letters, syntax and accessibility validation, etc.

## Objectives 
1. Demonstrate ability to write simple CSS - particularly the box model.
2. Use hexadecimal values for all colors
3. Demonstrate ability to host files properly
 
## Requirements
1. All files and folders present, HTML file and CSS stylesheet in proper format, no styles in HTML. Do not make changes to the HTML other than linking your stylesheet
2. Always name your stylesheet style.css and keep it in the css folder
3. Always name the default stylesheet html5reset.css and keep it in the css folder
4. Validate all of your code - do this throughout the entire process to catch issues early

## Tips
1. Write your CSS from broadest to narrowest. Look at the requirements, which ones apply to the whole page? Which ones only apply to certain sections? Use this to help define your CSS selectors.
2. If you get an error, use Inspect Element to check the current value.  Make sure that a different rule isn’t overriding a rule you wrote.
3. Don’t forget that you can validate CSS code using a validator
4. Order is important for many CSS parameters, including your fonts! Make sure your desired font and the fallback are in the right order
